# Typing Speed Calculator

This Python script calculates the typing speed of a user in words per minute. The user is asked to type a specific sentence, and the time taken to type this sentence is used to calculate the typing speed.

## Libraries Used

- `time`: This is a built-in Python library that provides various time-related functions. In this script, it is used to record the start and end time of the typing task.

## Functions

- `typing_speed(input_text, start_time, end_time)`: This function calculates the typing speed. It takes three parameters: the text input by the user, the start time of the typing task, and the end time of the typing task. It calculates the number of words in the input text (assuming an average word length of 5 characters), determines the time difference between the start and end times, and then calculates the typing speed in words per minute.

- `main()`: This is the main function that runs the script. It prompts the user to type a specific sentence, records the start and end times of the typing task, and then calls the `typing_speed` function to calculate the typing speed. The calculated speed is then printed to the console.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in a Python environment. You will be prompted to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." After typing the sentence, the script will calculate and display your average typing speed in words per minute.

## Note

This script assumes an average word length of 5 characters. This is a common assumption in typing speed tests, but it may not accurately reflect the word length in all types of text.

# Typing Speed Test in C#

This is a simple C# console application that measures your typing speed in words per minute. The program provides a sentence for you to type, starts a timer when you begin typing, and stops the timer when you finish. It then calculates your typing speed based on the time taken and the number of words in the sentence.

## Code Explanation

The script uses three namespaces from the .NET Framework:

- `System`: This namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.

- `System.Diagnostics`: This namespace provides classes that allow you to interact with system processes, event logs, and performance counters.

- `System.Linq`: This namespace provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).

The `Main` method is the entry point of the program. It first defines an array of words and joins them into a sentence. It then prompts the user to type this sentence.

A `Stopwatch` object is created and started before the user input is read from the console. The stopwatch is stopped after the input is read.

If the user's input matches the provided sentence, the program calculates the typing speed by dividing the number of words by the elapsed time in minutes. The result is then printed to the console.

If the user's input does not match the provided sentence, the program prints an error message to the console.

## Usage

To run the program, you need a .NET runtime environment. You can compile and run the program using the `dotnet run` command.

# Java Documentation

# Typing Speed Tester

This is a simple Java program that tests your typing speed. The program prompts you to type a specific sentence, and then calculates your typing speed in words per minute.

## How it works

The program uses a predefined sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". Once you start typing, the program starts a timer. When you finish typing, the timer stops. The program then calculates your typing speed based on the time it took you to type the sentence.

## Imported Libraries

The program uses three imported libraries:

1. `java.util.Scanner`: This library is used to read the user's input. In this program, it is used to capture the sentence that the user types.

2. `java.time.Duration`: This library is used to measure time in a machine-readable format. In this program, it is used to calculate the time difference between when the user starts typing and when they finish.

3. `java.time.Instant`: This library is used to capture the current time. In this program, it is used to mark the time when the user starts typing and when they finish.

## Code Explanation

The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It first prints the test sentence and then starts the timer. It then waits for the user to type the sentence and stops the timer when the user presses enter. If the user's input matches the test sentence, it calculates the typing speed and prints it. If the user's input does not match the test sentence, it prints an error message.

The `calculateSpeed` method is a helper method that calculates the typing speed. It takes the test sentence and the elapsed time as input, and returns the typing speed in words per minute. It calculates the speed by dividing the number of words in the test sentence by the elapsed time in minutes.
